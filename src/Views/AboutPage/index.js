						<h1>About Us</h1>
						<div className="subtitle">
							Sleeper brings people together over sports
						</div>
						<p>We built Sleeper to help strengthen bonds between friends, families, and co-workers.</p>
						<p>Some of our fondest memories include Super Bowl parties with classmates, water-cooler debates at work, watching Christmas NBA games in our pajamas with family, and playing in fantasy leagues with friends.</p>
						<p>We believe the biggest opportunity in sports does not lie in betting, content, or escapism, but rather in its power to bring people closer together and create new friendships.</p>
